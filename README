Test demo was introduced by Andreisavu. https://github.com/andreisavu/pyzk-recipes

I edited the source code to resolve errors and make the demo run. However, some features of the demo are not applicable because they require more debugging.     



steps to run:

$ cd test_5_trunk
$ ./start.sh
$ python fail.py 

in another shell do:

$ ./top.sh

As you can see the cluster is pretty unstable. 
fail.py kills and restarts one random node at a time. 
Even if this happens the application should be able
to easily survive server failures. 

Start the queue:

$ python queue.py 

You should see multiple "Connected" messages.
